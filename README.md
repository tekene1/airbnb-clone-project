# airbnb-clone-project

The Airbnb Clone backend is built to handle users, listings, bookings, and payments smoothly and efficiently.



## Project Goals
1. **User Management**: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
2. **Property Management**: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
3. **Booking System**: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
4. **Payment Processing**: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
5. **Review System**: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
6. **Data Optimization**: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## Technology Stack
- **Django:** A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- **Django REST Framework:** Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- **PostgreSQL:** A powerful relational database used for data storage.
- **GraphQL:** Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- **Celery:** For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- **Redis:** Used for caching and session management.
- **Docker:** Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## Database Design
- Users
- Properties
- Bookings
- Payments
- Reviews

## Team Roles
- **Backend Developer:** Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
- **Database Administrator:** Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
- **DevOps Engineer:** Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
- **QA Engineer:** Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

3. **Property Management**
    - Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.
4. **Booking System**
    - Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.
5. **Payment Processing**
    - Handle payment transactions related to bookings.
6. **Review System**
    - Post and manage reviews for properties.
7. **Database Optimizations**
    - **Indexing:** Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
    - **Caching:** Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.

## API Security
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Rate limiting

## CI/CD Pipeline
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are automated processes that integrate code changes, test, build, and deploy software applications. They bridge the gap between development, testing, and deployment, ensuring smooth and efficient delivery of software updates.
